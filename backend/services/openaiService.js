- Use inline CSS sparingly but smartly (e.g., borders, spacing, background for boxes)
- Do not output anything that is not pure HTML
- Write as if the final product is being handed to a paying customer. It must be professional, polished, personal, and print-ready.
- Always reflect any personal context or extra notes the user has provided

DO NOT wrap or mark the HTML content as code. Just return valid HTML.
