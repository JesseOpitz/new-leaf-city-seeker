              <p>
                New Leaf's recommendation engine works through a series of weighted comparisons:
              </p>
              
              <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2">
                <li>
                  <strong>Preference Weighting</strong> - Your slider inputs determine how heavily each factor is weighted in the overall score
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Ranking Inversion</strong> - We convert raw data rankings so that lower numbers are better (e.g., a crime_rank of 1 is the safest)
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Score Calculation</strong> - Each city receives a score based on how well it matches your weighted preferences
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Special Handling</strong> - Factors like density preference and political leaning use custom logic to find your ideal match
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Sorting and Selection</strong> - Cities are sorted by total score, and we present the top matches (and optionally, bottom matches)
                </li>

                New Leaf was created to help people find places where they can truly thrive. We believe that finding the right community
                and environment can dramatically improve quality of life, happiness, and personal growth.

                Our goal is to provide objective, data-driven recommendations that consider the full range of factors that make a place livable,
                from practical concerns like safety and affordability to lifestyle preferences like walkability and cultural fit.
              </p>
